# e-commerce-front
A e-commerce of varieties project

This is a project for my portfolio. In this project I will be able to put all the knowledge I've been gathering in the last two months. I will use 
json-server with NodeJs simulating a server, my products will be created dinamically through JS and I will use localStorage to save the client's cart
products if they refresh or leave the page and return.
